<p>myEDmatch easily integrates into your existing hiring and application systems via our applicant screening feature which links candidates directly from your website.

We can link your existing job postings and candidates directly from your website and cut down on profile, job setup, and candidate screening time. Screen all your applicants through myEDmatch to easily assess their fit with your school and encourage retention.

<br />
<p>If you'd like to learn more about this convenience feature and get it set up for your school or network, please contact Lisa French (<a href="mailto:lisa.french@myedmatch.com">lisa.french@myedmatch.com</a>).
</p>
				</div>
				</li>
				<li><b><a href='#' class='head'>Why can't I see my Match Scores / Why are Matches coming up blank?</a></b>
				<div class='content'>
<p>Before you can see match scores, your principal will need to complete a Core Beliefs Profile. This will take your principal no more than 5-10 minutes. We use this Core Beliefs Profile to determine how good of a "fit" an applicant is for your specific school. <b><i>To promote retention, Principals are the only individuals at schools who can fill out the Core Beliefs Profile.</i></b> This is because school leaders are integral to the culture of school, and study after study have shown that misalignment with the mission, vision, and culture set by the school’s administration is the primary driver of teacher attrition.  Your specific answers to each question will be kept private and will not be shared with potential candidates, but our "Match Score" is calculated on the basis of your answers to these questions. If you are not seeing Match Scores, please have your principal fill out the Core Beliefs Profile. If your principal cannot find the initial email we sent out to set up his or her account, please ask us about this by clicking the "Need Help" button on the upper right hand side of your screen and filling out a case.

				<li><b><a href='#' class='head'>How do I update my public profile to attract teachers?</a></b>
				<div class='content'>
<p>Completing your public profile on myEDmatch is quick and intuitive, and is the easiest way to market your school and attract potential candidates. Follow the steps below to build a profile that is compelling and that introduces potential candidates to your school.
</p>
<br />
<div style="padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto; background:#83b666; width:470px;">
<p style="text-align:left; color:#fff; font-size:13px; font-style:italic; font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; width:425px;"><img src="images/tip_icon.png" align="left" style="padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:25px;" /><b>ExpertTip:</b> Your Public Profile is indexed by Google and other search engines for both myEDmatch users and the public to see whether you take the time to build it out or not, so we highly recommend spending some time on this profile to put your school's "best foot forward." Taking the time to create a compelling profile now can help attract great candidates, whereas a profile that is less well-managed could turn potential candidates away.
</p>
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 1: Start by adding your school's logo to your profile.</b> Simply "hover" (put your mouse over) the circle image until you see text that says "Upload Profile Picture."
</p>
<br />
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto;"><img src="images/profilepic.jpg" />
</div>
<br />
<p>You can also upload a background image to the horizontal box at the top of your page. You can upload an image of any size into this box. Smaller images will be placed on a black "chalkboard" background as in the above image. If you don't like the chalkboard border around your image, you can upload an image that is 1280 pixels by 275 pixels. If you don't have software that allows you to do this easily, try using the free photo cropping tool at <a href="http://www.fotor.com/features/crop.html" target="_blank">www.fotor.com</a>.
</p>
<br />
<p><b>Step 2: Fill in written content on your public profile.</b> The information in the green circles will have been automatically filled based upon the principal's answers to the initial school demographic section during sign-up. If these sections are blank, please ask your principal to complete the 5-10 minute profile. You will not be able to see match scores of candidates until the principal completes this brief survey. Once this is completed, in the Public profile, sections we encourage you to complete include: "Our Mission," "Student Achievement Results," "In Our Own Words,"  "Leadership Opportunities," and "Living Here," in addition to uploading photos or videos to the "slider" sections as described in the next section. 
</p>
<br />
<div style="padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto; background:#83b666; width:470px;">
<p style="text-align:left; color:#fff; font-size:13px; font-style:italic; font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; width:425px;"><img src="images/tip_icon.png" align="left" style="padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:25px;" /><b>ExpertTip:</b> School and District profiles are different and have different sections. District managers can toggle between the two using the dropdown menu in the top left of the header. One *any* page in our portal, toggling this to the District will give you the "District overview" view of all of your schools, and allow you to view your district profile, whereas selecting an individual school from this dropdown menu will allow you to "View As" that specific school.

This will push out the information in these sections to all schools in your network.

</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 3: Complete your profile by adding photos and videos.</b> To any slider section of the profile, you can hit "Upload" or the "+" symbol to upload a photo, video, or pdf/document. For any uploaded document, please make sure that the only periods (.) in the name of the file come before the extension (ie "photo.jpg," "photo.png," "photo.pdf," etc, not "photo.extraperiod.jpg").

It's important to fill out content for every section of the school profile so that teachers don't see incomplete sections.
</p>
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 4: If you'd like, you can also invite your current teachers to join myEDmatch so that they can speak to what it's like to work at your school. These teachers will NOT be searchable in teacher search, they will just be visible and linked on your Profile page so potential teacher prospects can talk to them.</b>  Be sure to tell your teachers to indicate that they work at your school during the registration process.  When your school's teachers join myEDmatch, they will then appear in the dropdown list of staff members you can associate with your school so you can highlight them on your Public Profile.

This can be done either from the job description itself by clicking "Archive" in the upper right hand corner, or quickly from the Dashboard (by changing the status from "Active" to "Closed." Archiving your jobs that have already been filled will prevent your jobs tab from becoming cluttered. Archiving a job will not delete it, it will just store it on a different tab in your "Jobs" page so you can focus your attention on the jobs you still actively need to fill.

				<div class='content'>
<p>myEDmatch gives schools the power to search and sort for specific candidates unlike ever before using over a dozen different filters that school leaders like you have told us they care most about. Here are a few tips when getting started looking for teachers.
</p>
<br />
<p><b>Step 1: If you are part of a network/district with multiple schools, make sure that you select a school from the dropdown menu so you are viewing the page as that school, or you will be unable to view match scores.</b>  If you're a single site school you won't have to worry about this. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Match Scores will appear blank for candidates until the principal at the school has completed the 5-10 minute Core Beliefs Profile.</b></span>
</p>
<br />
<div style="text-align:center; margin:auto; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px;"><img src="images/schoolteachersreport.jpg" />
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 2: Next, pick from the list of your job postings to automatically apply job specific filters for that position.</b>  You should see automatic filters appear in the Active Filters box for Certification, Grade Level Preference, Minimum Years of Experience, and Preferred Subject upon selecting a job -- all of these filters are based on the criteria you established when setting up that specific job posting.
</p>
<br />
<div style="text-align:center; margin:auto; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px;"><img src="images/jobautofiller.jpg" />
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 3: Mark teachers you'd like to easily keep track of as "Favorites" by clicking the star under their Match Score; this enables you to easily track and manage your favorite teachers for each job.</b>  When you favorite teachers, they will receive an email indicating that you are interested in them and they will appear in your "Favorites" section of the Teachers tab, and on the "candidates" section of your Dashboard as a candidate for the job selected.
</p>
<br />
<div style="text-align:center; margin:auto; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px;"><img src="images/fav.jpg" />
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 4: Reach out to teachers that you've favorited to learn more about them or to encourage them to apply for additional roles at your school.</b> Once you favorite a teacher, go to the favorites tab; messaging a teacher is as easy as clicking the envelope beneath their apple Match Score, the envelope next to their name in the dashboard, or the envelope in their profile. You can view your entire messaging history with any given candidate by clicking this envelope.

<p><b>Step 1: Navigate to the "Recruiter &amp; School Leaders" section of the Dashboard.</b>
</p>
<br />
<div style="text-align:center; margin:auto; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px;"><img src="images/addschooluser.jpg" />
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 2: Fill out the first name, last name, email, schools the user will manage (for multi-school networks), and user type.</b> There are four basic user types on myEDmatch: Basic Access, Principal, Recruiter, and Network Admin:
<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
<li>Network Admins manage multiple schools and will be most relevant to multi-school networks. </li>
<li>Principals have the complete ability to edit the profile and they are the only person that can complete a school's Core Beliefs Profile.</li>
<li>Recruiter Access is the same as principal access except for the ability to complete the Core Beliefs Profile. </li>
<li>Basic Access is just that and is intended to be used by a teacher or administrative assistant that is helping with recruitment or interviewing.</li>
</ul>
</p> 
<br />
<p>You can also remove or change a users role directly from this section of the Dashboard.</p>

Do NOT add them for specific schools if they oversee more than one. If you have any questions about this, please contact us by creating a case by clicking the "Need Help" button at the upper right hand side of your screen.
