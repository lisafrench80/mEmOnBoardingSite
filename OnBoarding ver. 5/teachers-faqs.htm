</div>
<br />
<p>Or, if you'd like to learn more about the job before applying, click on the job title to go to the full job description page. Then, if you'd like to apply, simply click the star next to the words <b>Click Star to Apply.</b>

</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you joined myEDmatch as part of a school's application process — i.e. a link or widget on the school website, a job board other than myEDmatch, or a Twitter advertisement listing a specific job opening — you're automatically entered into a school's applicant pool, so there's no need to apply again by clicking the star, as the job will automatically appear in your "Interested" tab and favorite jobs list.

				<li><b><a href='#' class='head'>I'm trying to apply for a job from a school's website, why was I sent to myEDmatch?</a></b>
				<div class='content'>
<p>If you were sent to myEDmatch after clicking on a link on a school website, an external job posting, or a Twitter ad, the school has partenered with myEDmatch to identify teachers who will be the best mission, culture, and instructional fits for their positions. 
</p>
<p>After you finish your Core Beliefs Profile at the end of myEDmatch registration, you're given a Match Score that suggests to schools the degree to which you share similar educational beliefs and goals. Schools use this information to screen candidates before reaching out to start the formal application and interview process. <b><u>This is why it's very important to finish you myEDmatch registration, including the Core Beliefs Profile.</u></b>
</p>
<p>It's also in your best interest to build out a full professional profile so that when the school views it, they'll get the info they need to make an informed decision about whether or not to contact you.

				<li><b><a href='#' class='head'>Is myEDmatch free for teachers?</a></b>
				<div class='content'>
<p>Yes. When you sign up for myEDmatch for free, you're automatically entered into basic mode, which includes all of the features outlined in the table below. 
</p>
<p>To access premium features - including Match Scores and communication with schools - you can unlock them for free by completing your profile to 100% (as indicated by the green completion bar on your profile) or by paying a small fee of $8.00/month.

<p>A complete professional profile constitutes having at least one entry in each of the following sections:
<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
<li>Profile Picture</li>
<li>First Impression</li>
<li>Resume</li>
<li>Work Experience</li>
<li>Classroom Portfolio</li>

				<li><b><a href='#' class='head'>What is a Core Beliefs Profile?</a></b>
				<div class='content'>
<p>The Core Beliefs Profile is a simple 5-10 minute survey-like questionnaire designed to determine the level of alignment between your views on educational mission and culture and that of the school administration, and speaks to the likelihood that a teacher will be happy at that school long term.  myEDmatch will use the results of your Core Beliefs Profile to suggest schools with similar educational missions, beliefs, and goals as your own. 
</p>
<p>
The questionnaire includes seven core areas of education:
<ul class="numberlist" style="padding-left:20px;">
<li>Mission -  a shared set of beliefs around the purpose, goals, and aspirations of a school</li>
<li>Instruction - a specific approach to teaching and learning used in a school</li>
<li>Professional Development - support of teachers' professional growth and advancement</li>
<li>Planning - organization around the task of teaching and learning</li>
<li>Student Culture - students' shared beliefs, values, and behaviors concerning school</li>
<li>School Environment - the management of time, people, and resources through systems and structures</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Within each area is a series of statements, about which you will select the degree to which you agree or disagree. To do so, just click on the radio button indicating your level of agreement for each statement. Don't forget to click <b>Save</b> after completing each core section. It should take you no more than 5-10 minutes to complete. Once you've completed this profile, you can begin searching for jobs that are right for you using our more than 20 filters via the "Jobs" tab!

				<div class='content'>
<p>
Whether you're looking for your first job, your next job, or a place to showcase the awesome work you're doing in your current job, building a visually-compelling digital professional portfolio is the place to start. In addition to the basics, like detailing your education and experience, your professional profile lets you showcase yourself to schools and other teachers in a way a traditional resume can't. And the best part is, you can build it quickly and easily by following the steps below. 
</p>
<br />
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto; background:#83b666; width:470px;">
<p style="text-align:left; color:#fff; font-size:14px; font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; width:425px;"><img src="images/tip_icon.png" align="left" style="padding-right:10px;" /><b>ExpertTip:</b> If you complete your profile, as reflected by the profile completion bar in the top-right corner, you can unlock premium features, which include the following: Match Scores, messaging with schools, and the ability to see which schools have favorited you. A complete profile is at least one entry in each of the 10 profile sections. <a href="unlockpremium.htm"><b>Learn more >></b></a>
</p>
</div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 1: Complete the 'header' section by adding a profile picture, First Impression, and resume.</b> This section of your profile is important because it's the first thing school recruiters and principals see when they view your profile. In other words, it's your virtual first impression.
</p>
<p>To add your profile picture, hover over the default image and click <b>Upload Profile Picture</b> (#1).
</p>
<p>To write your First Impression, click <b>edit</b>, which will open up a text field where you can craft a 140-character introduction (#2). This is a great place to share what you stand for! 
</p>
<p>To upload your resume, click on the <b>Upload Resume</b> button (#3). A blue icon will appear below the button when your resume has been successfully uploaded.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center; margin:auto; padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px;"><img src="images/profileheader.png" /></div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 2: Add your work, education, and leadership experience.</b> Continue building your professional profile and portfolio by adding your personal details, including photos and videos, in each section. Just click <b>Add New</b> or <b>Upload</b> in the upper-right corner of each section. Make sure to hit <b>Save</b> then <b>Done</b> when uploading content.
</p>
<br />
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto; background:#83b666; width:470px;">
<p style="text-align:left; color:#fff; font-size:14px; font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; width:425px;"><img src="images/tip_icon.png" align="left" style="padding-right:10px;" /><b>ExpertTip:</b>  Whether in the classroom, your previous career, or in your undergraduate program, school leaders want to know where you've made measurable impact. Just as important, they want to see evidence of a growth mindset. So, share your accomplishments as well as your goals for professional development.
</p>
<br />
</div>
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto;"><img src="images/workexperience.png" /></div>
<br />
<p><b>Step 3: Add endorsements from administrators, colleagues, professors, even students and parents.</b> When principals and recruiters hear: "Hire, [Insert Your Name Here]!" from people who know your work, they get excited. So, the Endorsements section of your profile makes it easy for you to invite others to vouch for your skills. 
</p>
<p>Just click <b>Request Endorsements</b> and then select from whom you'd like to receive an endorsement. 
</p>
<br />
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto;"><img src="images/requestendorsements.png" /></div>
<br />
<p>When you click <b>Request Endorsement</b> again, myEDmatch automatically sends an email to the selected individual(s) inviting him/her to write a quick endorsement.</p>
<div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center; margin:auto;"><img src="images/requestendorsements2.png" /></div>
<p><b>Step 4: (Optional) Link to your DonorsChoose.org account.</b> Click <b>Add</b> in the upper-right corner of the portfolio section under Leadership. Enter your DonorsChoose.org ID number. 
</p>
<p>If you don't know your number, log into your DonorsChoose.org account, place your cursor over you name in the upper-right corner, and click <b>Account</b>. Scroll to the bottom of the page where your <b>Teacher ID Number</b> is listed. Copy it over to your myEDmatch profile, and you're all set!
</p>
<p><b>Step 5: (Optional) Ask a mentor to review your profile and make notes for improvement.</b> Click <b>Share Private Link with Mentor</b> and you can either retrieve your personal myEDmatch URL to share directly with your mentor or myEDmatch can send a request via email for you.
</p>

				<li><b><a href='#' class='head'>How do I share my Professional Profile with others?</a></b>
				<div class='content'>
<p>After you've worked hard to build your professional profile, don't keep it under wraps. Share it on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and in emails - because although myEDmatch is one of of the best ways to find a teaching job these days, one method continues to work better than any other: word of mouth. 
</p>
<p>First, make sure your privacy settings are set to <b>anyone</b>. Then, to share it on social media, click the appropriate blue share button(s) located in the top-right corner of your profile.

				<div class='content'>
<p>myEDmatch promotes mission and culture alignment by connecting schools and teachers with shared educational beliefs and goals, with the goal of helping schools and teachers find a match that they will be happy with and will last in the long term. We provide teachers with their dream job opportunities and help them thrive in their careers. 
</p>
<p>Unlike job boards, teachers can use myEDmatch to:
<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
<li>Build a professional teaching portfolio that can be shared publicly</li>
<li>Get matched to schools based on mission, cultural, and instructional alignment to help encourage successful school:teacher matches for the long term</li>
<li>Search for their dream jobs based on the criteria that matters most to them, offering over 20 different search filters</li>
<li>Communicate with and apply for positions at their favorite schools</li>
<li>Get discovered by schools looking for teachers just like them</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br />
				</div>

				<li><b><a href='#' class='head'>How does matching work?</a></b>
				<div class='content'>
<p>Match scores represent the degree of similarity or disparity between a teacher's and school's educational alignment within seven core areas of education: mission, instruction, professional development, planning, student culture, staff culture, and school environment. 
</p>
<p>This alignment is assessed using the Core Beliefs Profile, which both teachers and schools complete upon joining myEDmatch, and speaks to the likelihood that a teacher will be happy at that school long term.
</p>
<p>Match Scores are represented by apples, with five apples suggesting a complete beliefs match and zero apples suggesting a complete beliefs mismatch. To view Match Scores on myEDmatch, you'll first need to unlock premium features for free by completing your professional profile to 100% or by paying $8.00/month. Click here to learn more.

<div class='content'>
<p>School leaders look for a completed professional profile. They have indicated that they look first for work experience, evidence of impact (student achievement scores and other accomplishments), and a sample teaching video. Beyond that, there are a number of things you can do to build a profile that really stands out. In fact, we have checklists to help you do just that.
</p>

</p>
<p>Many teachers don't have a sample teaching video, so having one will really make you stand out in a crowded, competitive market. In fact, many schools actually filter their searches so they can quickly and easily identify the teachers who've uploaded sample teaching videos.
</p>
<p>But no worries if you don't have one yet. The process of creating a teaching video can take a little time, but it's worth it.

<li><b><a href='#' class='head'>How do I add student achievement data to my profile without violating privacy laws?</a></b>
<div class='content'>
<p>You're probably aware of The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Learn more about FERPA <a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. It's possible, however, to communicate your student achievement results without disclosing the names of individual students. We recommend either sharing your classes' aggregate results (i.e. 93% of students scored a 4 or higher on the Kansas State Reading Assessment) or uploading data trackers without names or with faux names.

<li><b><a href='#' class='head'>How can I find the status of my application?</a></b>
<div class='content'>
<p>You can keep track of the jobs you've applied to from Homeroom > Jobs You're Interested In or Jobs > Interested tabs. As schools update the status of your application, it will be reflected in each of these places. You'll also receive an email from myEDmatch. 
</p>
<p>The different statuses include: Applied, Resume &amp; Portfolio Review, Phone Screen, 1st Round Interview, 2nd Round Interview, Referral/Background Check, Hired, or Rejected.

<div class='content'>
<p>In order to communicate with schools via messaging on myEDmatch, you'll first need to unlock premium features for free by completing your professional profile to 100% or by paying $8.00/month. Click here to learn more.  
</p>
<p>A complete professional profile constitutes having at least one entry in each of the following sections:
<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
<li>Profile Picture</li>
<li>First Impression</li>
<li>Resume</li>
<li>Work Experience</li>
<li>Classroom Portfolio</li>
<li>Student Achievement Results</li>
<li>Education, Training &amp; Skills</li>
<li>Supporting Evidence</li>
<li>Leadership</li>
<li>Endorsements</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Once you've unlocked premium features, messaging is 1:1, meaning you get one response for every message a school sends you, so make it count!  This ensures that school principals and recruiters aren't inundated with messages from teachers, and ultimately makes the application and selection process move along more quickly for everyone.
